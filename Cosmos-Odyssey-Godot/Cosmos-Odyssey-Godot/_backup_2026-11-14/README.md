# Cosmos: Odyssey '2000 (Godot 4 version)

Godot 4 remake of the web game in `Cosmos-Odyssey-2000/`. Same rules, same events, same numbers.

2. Everything is built in code. There are no images or sounds to import.

## Controls
- Menus: click, or press the number shown on the option. **Enter** continues.
- Free camera at stops: drag with the left mouse button, mouse wheel to zoom.
- Asteroid fields: arrow keys / WASD, or hold the left mouse button and drag.
- **F11** toggles fullscreen. The **Sound** button (bottom right) turns the drone and beeps on.
- Crew screen has a **Quick start** button (Pilot + Engineer + Medic) for fast demos.

## Files

## Automated test options (optional)
Run from a terminal: `godot --headless --path . -- --bot=smart --speed=25`
Bots: `smart`, `lazy`, `random`, `dumb`. It prints a `RESULT {...}` line at the end.

## Mission Campaign
The start screen offers **Mission Campaign** (5 levels, 20 stages, 5 special missions) or the classic Grand Tour.
- `scripts/campaign_data.gd` destinations (real science + game hazard severities), equipment, levels
- `scripts/mission.gd` spacecraft design, mission state, Environmental Damage Engine, operations, probe, scoring
- `scripts/challenges.gd` universal mission challenges, planetary events, engineering decisions
- `scripts/campaign.gd` campaign flow and screens (briefing, design, Mission Lab, assessment)
- Progress is saved in `user://campaign.cfg`.
- Test one stage: `godot --headless --path . -- --bot=smart --speed=40 --campaign=5 --diff=advanced` (prints `CAMPAIGN_RESULT {...}`). Special missions: `--campaign=sm1` to `sm5`. `--unlock` opens every stage.

## Differences from the web version
- Saturn moved from 165 to 120 degrees on its orbit. In the web version it sat exactly behind the comet.
